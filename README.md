**Repository Name:** Logistic-Regression-Tumor-Diagnosis

**Description:**
This repository contains Python code for implementing logistic regression to diagnose tumors based on age and tumor size data. The provided code includes functions for computing the cost, performing gradient descent, and making predictions using the logistic regression model.

**Features:**
- **Data Generation:** The code generates synthetic tumor diagnosis data, where each data point represents a patient's age and tumor size.
- **Visualization:** It visualizes the synthetic dataset, distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors using scatter plots.
- **Logistic Regression Implementation:** Implements logistic regression with functions for sigmoid activation, cost computation, and gradient descent optimization.
- **Prediction:** Allows users to input patient data (age and tumor size) and predicts whether the tumor is benign or malignant, along with the probability of malignancy.

**Usage:**
1. Run the provided code to generate synthetic data and visualize it.
2. Perform logistic regression by setting hyperparameters and executing gradient descent.
3. Input patient data to predict tumor diagnosis.

**Dependencies:**
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/Logistic-Regression-Tumor-Diagnosis.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib`
3. Run the code: `python tumor_diagnosis.py`
